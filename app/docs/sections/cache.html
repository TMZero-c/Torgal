    <h2>Model cache</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Model files are downloaded on first run and stored in the HuggingFace cache.</li>
        <li>The Preferences window lets you open the cache folder or clear it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Clearing the cache frees disk space but forces a re-download the next time those models are used.
