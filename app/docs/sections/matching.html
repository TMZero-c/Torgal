    <h2>Matching and analytics</h2>
    <p>
        Torgal compares speech embeddings against slide embeddings and applies keyword/title boosts. By default,
        it considers the current slide and its neighbors for stable transitions.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Window words</strong>: how much recent speech is considered.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooldown words</strong>: minimum words between transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Match threshold</strong>: minimum confidence to trigger a change.</li>
        <li><strong>Match difference</strong>: required gap vs the current slide.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay/forward/back bias</strong>: how eager the matcher is to move.</li>
        <li><strong>Recency weighting</strong>: recent words are emphasized for intent stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword/title boosts</strong>: lexical overlap increases confidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence embeddings</strong>: hybrid scoring for bullets (current/adjacent, or all in Q&A).</li>
        <li><strong>Intent-changing phrase</strong>: phrase most responsible for the current intent shift.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Partial matching can trigger early transitions while you speak. It is useful for responsiveness but can
        increase CPU usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local matching compares the previous, current, and next slides for stability. Q&A mode expands matching
        across all slides with stricter thresholds and a larger window. Non-adjacent jumps are available via
        config/env overrides but are disabled by default. Keyword-only matching skips embeddings entirely.

        Example: if your talk is closely scripted, you can lower the threshold slightly and keep the stay bias
        low. For ad‑lib talks, raise the threshold and increase stay bias to prevent jumps.
