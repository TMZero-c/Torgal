    <h2>CPU vs GPU performance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>GPU mode is designed for real-time use and larger models.</li>
        <li>CPU mode can be significantly slower without smaller models or nuclear options.</li>
        <li>If CPU is lagging, choose smaller models and enable batch audio or keyword-only matching.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If GPU is available but not detected, confirm that CUDA drivers and a compatible PyTorch build are
        installed in the Python environment used by Torgal.
