    <h2>Q&A mode</h2>
    <p>
        Q&A mode enables global matching across all slides. It is useful for open-ended questions that jump to
        non-adjacent topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q&A mode uses its own thresholds, window size, and recency bias. Switching modes clears recent context
        to avoid mixing talk segments. The audio buffer is slightly larger in Q&A by default. You can tune the
        window and threshold in Preferences under Advanced; diff, recency, and Q&A buffer size are configurable
        via env/config.
