    <h2>Slideshow window</h2>
    <p>
        The slideshow window opens automatically when a presentation is loaded. If a second display is
        available, the window moves there and goes full screen. The slideshow advances when a transition
        is triggered by voice or explicit commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        On single-display setups, the slideshow stays windowed and can be positioned manually. Arrow keys
        in the slideshow window advance locally without changing the presenter preview or matching state.
