    <ol>
        <li>Launch Torgal and allow microphone access.</li>
        <li>Click Upload Presentation (or File → Open Presentation) and select a PDF. PPTX is best-effort.</li>
        <li>Wait for parsing and embedding to finish. Audio pauses automatically while models load.</li>
        <li>Start speaking; transitions trigger when confidence clears the threshold and required diff.</li>
        <li>Use Pause/Resume to stop listening (pausing also resets the matching context).</li>
        <li>Toggle Q&A mode when you need global matching across all slides; switching clears recent context.</li>
    </ol>

        On first run, model downloads can take time. If you see a loading state, keep the app open until the
        models finish downloading.
