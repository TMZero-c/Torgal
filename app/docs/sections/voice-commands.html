    <h2>Voice commands</h2>
    <p>Voice commands are detected before embeddings for immediate control.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“next slide”, “go/advance/move to next slide”</li>
        <li>“previous/prior slide”, “go back a slide”</li>
        <li>“slide 5”, “go/jump/skip to slide 5”</li>
        <li>“first slide”, “last slide”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Commands are matched at the start of an utterance (using the last N words), so say them first for the
        best results. Cooldowns and minimum-words-between rules prevent rapid repeats.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slide numbers are one-based in speech. Saying “slide 1” moves to the first slide.
