            These settings are for machines where real-time performance is not possible. They reduce accuracy
            to keep the app responsive.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Batch Audio Mode</strong>: processes audio in large intervals instead of streaming.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch Interval (ms)</strong>: higher values reduce CPU at the cost of more delay.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword-only Matching</strong>: skips embeddings entirely and uses keyword overlap only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Recommended order: first lower model sizes, then enable batch audio, then enable keyword-only matching
        if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keyword-only matching skips all embeddings and uses token overlap (with a small title bonus), which can
        reduce intent detail and analytics richness.
