    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Torgal is a local-first presenter assistant. It captures microphone audio, transcribes speech on-device,
        and uses semantic matching to decide when to advance slides.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Electron provides the presenter UI and slideshow window.</li>
        <li>Python handles transcription, embeddings, and matching.</li>
        <li>Explicit voice commands are matched before embeddings for immediate control.</li>
        <li>Whisper hotwords are derived from slide text to improve recognition.</li>
        <li>All processing runs on-device; no cloud API is required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Data flow is intentionally modular: audio and UI remain in Electron, while ML logic runs in Python. Each
        stage (capture, transcription, matching, transition) can be tuned independently.
